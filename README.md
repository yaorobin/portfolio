# Implementing Optimal Portfolio Strategy through AIGC
In the field of asset allocation, we often need to combine different assets in a reasonable manner based on the risk preferences and investment objectives of the investor to achieve the optimal balance of risk and return.

I will use the AIGC model to help me optimize my porfolio. The specific goal is to construct an investment portfolio that includes stocks, bonds, and real estate, aiming to maximize the portfolio's return and minimize volatility (standard deviation), achieving a balance between risk and return through a reasonable investment combination.
